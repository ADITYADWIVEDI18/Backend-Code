/* 
when you were trying to go to local host:3000 then we land inside the get block and we could see when we were
trying to render list where only passing the value for this variable that is "kindOfDay" we arenot passing anything "newListItem" .
so when it tries to render a list at this point then it doesn,t actually have a value to put into this newListItem EJS tag and thats why our app crashes.

So now know that every single time your try to render a list we have to provide both variable that we want to render,
so to probably fix this error we have to add "newListItem" to our render
